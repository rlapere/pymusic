# Time series into music with Python

This repository contains a `Python` jupyter notebook (*climate_to_music.ipynb*) showing how one can transform data from 
a time series (here within the context of climate data) into a MIDI music file. This MIDI file can be further edited afterwards using a dedicated software.
A basic example is provided here but virtually one could imagine adding many tracks from may time series to create a more symphonic music 
(like the .mp3 example provided in the data folder, showing that 4 tracks with different instruments already sounds a lot better than the example from the notebook)
